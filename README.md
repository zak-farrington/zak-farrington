## **I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with 15 YOE.**
- 🏢 **In my professional role** I am leading technical projects, enhancing software quality, collaborating with my team and embracing challenges.
- 🎯 **Out-of-office I am currently** creating projects that showcase my capabilities and recent experience.
- 🌱 **I'm currently studying** system design and best-in-industry software architectural patterns.
- 🧘 **Beyond my technical pursuits** I enjoy practicing meditation and an ongoing exploration of subjective consciousness.
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I've added _"old-school-cool"_ C++ & MASM repositories for projects I wrote over 20 years ago, when I was 15 years old!
