## **I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with 15 YOE.**
- 🏢 **In my professional role:** I am leading technical projects, enhancing software quality, coordinating, and thriving in challenges.
- 🎯 **Out-of-office:** I am currently creating projects that showcase my capabilities and recent experience.
- 🌱 **I'm deepening my knowledge in:** software architecture and system design, and exploring Azure's cloud services *(PaaS & IaaS)*.
- 🧘 **Beyond my technical pursuits:** I enjoy practicing meditation and an ongoing exploration of subjective consciousness.
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I've added _"old-school-cool"_ repositories *(C++ & MASM32)* for projects I wrote over 20 years ago, at age 15!
